Generic Class in java  is a feature. We write code once and use it for any data type including user defined data types.
Given an integer or a string as an input.Print the type of input and the given value as output.

Input:
The first line will contain an integer T (number of test cases). First line of each test case will contain one integer c.
Next line will contain a string if c is equal to 1 or will contain a integer if c is equal to 2.

Output:
Print the type of the given data and the given value in new line.

Constraints:
1 < = T < = 100
1 < = c < = 2
1<= Length of strings, integers<=103

Example:
Input:
2               0   Length of Output = this * 2
1               1   Divided by one = Integer or String
gfg             2   Divided by two = value
2               3
5               4

Output:
String
gfg
Integer
